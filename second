2. River Crossing Problem
Problem Breakdown:
A man, a woman, and two children need to cross a river.
The boat can only carry up to 100 kg.
The man and woman weigh 80 kg each, and the children weigh 30 kg each.
The boat can be driven by anyone.
Prolog Code:
We can model the state of the river crossing problem with the following rules:

The initial state is that all four people are on the left bank of the river.
The goal is to get all four to the right bank.
Moves consist of selecting one or two people to take the boat across, and then bringing the boat back with someone.

% Define people's weights
weight(man, 80).
weight(woman, 80).
weight(child1, 30).
weight(child2, 30).

% Define the crossing rules
cross(State, NewState) :-
    % Two people can cross together if their combined weight is â‰¤ 100 kg
    select(X, State, S1), 
    select(Y, S1, S2), 
    weight(X, Wx), 
    weight(Y, Wy), 
    Wx + Wy =< 100,
    append([X, Y], [], Pair),
    subtract(State, Pair, NewState).

% Define valid states
valid_state(Left, Right) :-
    \+ (member(man, Left), member(woman, Right)),  % Man and woman can't be separated
    \+ (member(child1, Left), member(child2, Right)).  % Children can't be separated

% Recursive state transitions
river_crossing(Left, Right) :-
    valid_state(Left, Right), 
    cross(Left, Right),
    writeln(Right).
